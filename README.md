# üìà Propositional Analyzer

## üåü Introduction

Propositional Analyzer is a powerful tool built with Flutter for analyzing propositional logic expressions. It offers various algorithms to solve boolean satisfacation problems and provides insightful visualizations of the results.

### [See Web Showcase üéâ](https://tonygnk.github.io/propositional_analyzer/)

## ‚ú® Features

### Single Analysis

- Finds the critical value of the ratio M/N (Number of disjunctions/Propositional symbols), i.e. the value for which the majority of problems change from satisfiable to unsatisfiable.

### Multiple Analysis

- Enables direct comparison of algorithm performance on identical problem sets.

### Presentation of Results

- Visualizes results in modern and helpful graph charts.

### Save and Load Analysis

- Saves the analysis locally in a txt file.
- Loads previously saved analyses for further review.

### Preloaded Saved Analyses

- Comes with a set of useful preinstalled analyses on the collection screen.
